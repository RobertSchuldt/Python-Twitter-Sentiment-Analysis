This was a small experiment to look into creating a twitter sentiment analysis using a
collection of tweets I had downloaded using the twitter API system. The initial upload
says RFSIndustries as that was an older github user ID I had signed up for but never 
ended up using. I would like to develop this idea further by creating a streaming
sentiment analysis that allows for visual interpretation of the streaming tweets in 
real time. 

I relied on using a tutorial to figure out how to run this and learned some very interesting
tidbits of Python while working on this project.
